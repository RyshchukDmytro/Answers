# **Answers Flutter/Swift Technical Assessment**

**Objective**

The purpose of this assignment is to assess your iOS development skills, UI/UX attention to detail, and ability to implement smooth animations and gestures.
You will recreate a Today View card from the Apple App Store using Flutter or Swift, focusing on both visual accuracy and interactive functionality based on
the https://www.figma.com/design/Fg1USdY8YR3vIdMkxGSDLM/Untitled-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=g3TAZfcPotwPAtUr-1

**Duration:** This task is estimated to take 4-5 hours. You have 5 days from receiving the assignment to submit your work. If you need more time, please email *** for an extension.

**Priority:** We prioritize fidelity to UI and Motion design. Complete as much as possible within the given time.

**Requirements**

**Visual and Motion Design:**

- **High-Fidelity UI:**
- Recreate the card and expanded page’s visual design to match the provided Figma as closely as possible.
Pay attention to spacing, typography, and color schemes. Include the interactions for:
- Opening, scrolling, revealing the app banner, share, download, and closing.
- **Smooth Animations:**
- Implement animations for:
- Expanding the card on tap or swipe.
- Closing the card via swipe down or close button.
- Sliding up the app banner.
- Recreating the app download and share animations.
- Ensure animations use natural easing curves similar to Apple’s App Store motion standards.
- **Gesture Interactions:**
- Enable gestures such as tapping/swiping up to expand, swiping down/tapping close to collapse.

**Core Functionality:**

- **Dynamic Content:**
- Display content such as an image, title, subtitle, and description sourced from a local JSON file or mock API (no need to build backend APIs).
- **Interactive Buttons:**
- Simulate key button behaviors:
    - **Download Button:** Show a progress animation when tapped.
    - **Share Button:** Trigger a share action or show a simulated share menu.

**Platform Support:**

- The app should work smoothly on iOS devices.

**Documentation:**

- Provide a README with:
    - Instructions for building and running the app.
    - Details about your design choices and dependencies used.

Evaluation Criteria

- **Visual Design and Faithfulness to UI (40%)**
    - The app’s design should closely match the Figma mockup (typography, spacing, colors).
    - Animations should resemble the Today View card experience from Apple’s App Store.
- **Functionality (30%)**
    - Gestures should work seamlessly.
    - Button functionalities (e.g., progress animations for downloads) should enhance user experience.
    - Dynamic content should load properly.
- **Interaction and Motion Quality (20%)**
    - Gestures and animations should be smooth and natural.
- **Code Quality and Scalability (10%)**
    - The code should be modular, reusable, and well-structured
- **Dynamic Data:** Use a local JSON file or mock API to simulate content loading.
- **External Resources:** You may use online resources or generative AI tools (like ChatGPT), but be ready to explain your decisions.
