This is a Swift-based iOS application built with Xcode and SwiftUI

## Requirements
- Xcode 16.1 or newer
- iOS 16.0 or newer

## How to Build and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   * git clone https://github.com/RyshchukDmytro/Dmytro-Ryshchuk-AnswersAi-iOS.git
   * cd Dmytro-Ryshchuk-AnswersAi-iOS
3. open Dmytro-Ryshchuk-AnswersAi-iOS.xcodeproj

## Pattern
I used MVVM because it is a good fit for this app, and it is widely known among developers, allowing them to join the project and contribute from day one

## Frameworks
I did not add any frameworks or use any Swift Package Managers

## Time to complete
5 hours 3 minutes

## Data
I used internal JSON files

## How to improve
- dynamic colors
- files to reuse systemImages, colors, values
- more animations
- add localization
- add dynamic fonts
- add more objects
- polish classes further by dividing large functions into smaller, reusable components to enhance maintainability and scalability
